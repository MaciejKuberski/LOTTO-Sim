# LOTTO-Sim

this program simulates lotto draw using Shuffle from Random.
List of numbers from 1 to 49 will be used, that will be later shuffeled to achieve randomness. First six numbers will 
be selected as the random LOTTO winning numbers.

First step is to take 6 integers from user and put them in a list. Then sort the list for better visual effect.
Next the program shuffles a list from 1 to 49 and creates new list with the first 6 numbers from the shuffled list.

The last step is to compare the two lists, to determine how many numbers did the user get correctly and print the score.
